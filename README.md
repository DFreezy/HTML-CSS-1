**Introduction**
HTML and CSS are the foundation of web development and the building blocks of web pages. The web consists of three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. &nbsp;
**Programming languages** - known for their logical and consistent nature.
**Internet** - acts as the meeting point for human and computer languages. 
**Semantic markup**

**Hypertext Mockup Language (HTML)**

# HTML-CSS
**Introduction**
HTML and CSS are the foundation of web development and the building blocks of web pages. The web consists of three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
**Programming languages** - known for their logical and consistent nature.<br>
**Internet** - acts as the meeting point for human and computer languages. <br>
**Semantic markup** <br>
•	means labelling content for what it is.
•	using semantic markup, ensures that screen readers and search engines can accurately interpret and categorize the information on a page. <br>
**What is a confident computer user?** <br>
•	Knowing how to cope when things go wrong
•	 Knowing how to learn new computing skills independently <br>

**Hypertext Mockup Language (HTML)** <br>
•	HTML forms the foundation of website and web app development
•	Has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions – this is known as declarative language
•	 It is the language that allows you to make sure your content is understandable to both people and computers
•	Responsible for marking up the content of a website
•	Grants access to a wide range of built-in browser functionalities that can be utilized by incorporating specific HTML code.
•	HTML is designed to structure our content and bridge the gap between human and computer languages.
•	Html is simple and offers resilience and robustness
•	It handles missing and misspelled elements by taking a guess and fixing it. It displays the page regardless of the misspelled elements. <br>
**Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)** <br>
•	CSS is responsible of the look and feel of the web page, this includes the colors, fonts, and sizes used. Also capable of adding animation and interactions
•	Hiccups in the CSS code, the browser skips that part and move on to the rest. <br>
**JavaScript** <br>
•	JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages
•	Allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions
•	It enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.
•	JavaScript can be a bit fragile/delicate at times, this is because If there is an issue with the code or the browser is outdated and does not understand the code it refuses to run and does not figure out what to do like HTML or CSS <br>
**Web Browser and Website** <br>
**Website** - it is expected to work even after several years without any updates. <br>
**Web** <br>
•	runs on various platforms like Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, and more. 
•	Enable people to share content, even when our computers are different.
•	Relies on three different programming languages — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
•	Combining these languages, developers can achieve resilience, robustness, and power in their websites. <br>

**Text Formatting** <br>
**Html Syntax** <br>
•	Html is a language used to structure web pages and tags.
•	The purpose of HTML markup is to give meaning to the content and help computers understand it. It serves as a bridge between the human and computer worlds.
•	Tags are enclosed in a less-than and greater-than symbols to mark different elements.
•	Common mistake in HTML is forgetting to include the closing tag at the end of an element. <br>
**Tags** <br>
•	tags work together to define elements, which are like packages containing contents
•	Some of these elements require both opening and closing tags, but some don’t 
•	Anything placed a closing tag will still be displayed on the same HTML page, but the browser will understand it as being outside the tag. <br>
**Types of tags:*
•	opening tags – example <p>
•	closing tags – example </p> <br>
**Elements** <br>
•	HTML elements can be nested within one another
•	For example, the <em> element can be used inside the <p> element to emphasize a text.
•	Choice of HTML elements impact the user experience on your website, including people with various disabilities. It all starts with nesting those HTML elements. <br>
**Document Object Model tree (DOM)** <br>
•	It pays attention to the structure of how everything is related.
•	It is used by the browser to create accessibility <br>
**HTML Paragraphs** <br>
•	It is important to have opening and closing tags to indicate each paragraph on web page, if not the browser will show your paragraphs as a single chunk text. <br>
**HTML Headlines** <br>
•	Play crucial role in helping people understand the web page structure
•	Headlines are the main content on landing pages, they act as clickable titles that leads readers to further information.
•	They can be found everywhere
•	There is html elements used for marking up headlines which are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. These elements have difference or a distinctive visual effect and convey a sense of hierarchy.
•	The size from h1 to h6 goes from big to small, making h1 the largest and most prominent and h6 the smallest and least attention grabbing
•	Choice of the headline level is its meaning and not the appearance. Meaning it would make sense to make the main heading a h1 and the subheading a h2. This is to be able to distinguish what is most important and what is less important.<br>
**Html Bold and Italics** <br>
•	The are four html elements related to these, two for bold and two for italic
•	The reason we use italics is to make strong points
